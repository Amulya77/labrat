<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML elements are represented by tags. -->
<!-- What is a tag? -->
 <!-- A tag is a pair of angle brackets that surround the content of an HTML element. The opening
tag is the first tag in a pair. The closing tag is the second tag in a pair. The content is the
text or other elements that are placed between the opening and closing tags. -->

<!-- What is an attribute? -->
 <!-- An attribute is a special keyword used to provide additional information about an HTML element. Attributes are always specified in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value". -->

<!-- What is the basic structure of an HTML document? -->



<!-- The basic structure of an HTML document consists of the following parts:   
<!DOCTYPE html> declaration: This declaration is used to specify the version of HTML that the document is using. It is placed at the beginning of the document.
<html> element: This element is the root element of an HTML page. It contains all the other HTML elements on the page.
<head> element: This element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title of the page, links to external stylesheets, and scripts.
<meta> element: This element provides metadata about the HTML document, such as the character encoding and viewport settings.
<title> element: This element specifies the title of the HTML document, which is displayed in the browser
<body> element: This element contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.
    -->



<!-- self closing tags -->
 <!-- self closing tags are used to represent elements that do not have any content. They are represented by
a single tag with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket, like this: <tag/>. 
Examples of self-closing tags include <img/>, <br/>, and <hr/>. -->

<!-- the list element -->

<!-- The list element is used to create lists in HTML. There are two types of list elements:
<ul> element: This element is used to create an unordered list, where the list items are displayed with bullet points.
<ol> element: This element is used to create an ordered list, where the list items are displayed with numbers or letters.
List items are represented by the <li> element, which is placed inside the <ul> or <ol> element. -->
    <!-- The list element can be used to create nested lists, where a list item contains another list.
     The nested list is represented by the <ul> or <ol> element inside the <li
        element. -->

<!-- The image element -->
 <!-- The image element is used to add images to an HTML document. It is represented by the <
img> tag, which is a self-closing tag. The src attribute is used to specify the URL of the image file, and the alt attribute is used to provide a text description of the image. -->
<!-- The image element can be used to add images to a web page, and can be used
to create image links. -->

<!-- The anchor element -->
 <!-- The anchor element is used to create hyperlinks in HTML. It is represented by the <a> tag, which
contains an href attribute that specifies the URL of the link destination. The text or image that is
linked is placed between the opening and closing <a> tags. -->
<!-- The anchor element can be used to create text links, image links, and email links. -->
 <!-- The anchor element can be used to create links to other web pages, email addresses, and other
  resources.
The target attribute can be used to specify where the linked content should be displayed, such as in a new window or tab. -->

<!-- The unordered list element -->
 <!-- The unordered list element is used to create lists in HTML where the order of the list items does not matter. It is represented by the <ul> tag, which contains one or more list items represented by the <li> tag. The list items are displayed with bullet points. -->
<!-- The unordered list element can be used to create simple lists of items, such as a list of links or a list of items with no specific order. -->


<!-- The ordered list element -->
 <!-- The ordered list element is used to create lists in HTML where the order of the list items is important. It is represented by the <ol> tag, which contains one or more list items represented by the <li> tag. The list items are displayed with numbers or letters. -->
<!-- The ordered list element can be used to create lists of items that need to be displayed in a specific order, such as a list of steps in a process or a list of items with a ranking. -->
